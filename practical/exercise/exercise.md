# QEM 2025 Practical Session

This document describes the practical session for QEM2025 related to image processing.

## Setup

From a terminal activate the `conda` environment using:

```bash
conda activate TP_AI
```

Then update the course materials using

```bash
tp-update
```

## Objective

The objective is to carry out measurements on a sample of gold nanoparticles using STEM imaging, using a simulated microscope suffering from severe sample drift. Imaging quickly to mitigate the drift leads to poor signal-to-noise ratio images, while scanning too large an area slowy adds distortion as the sample drifts during a scan.
